# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to X. If X is 100 then the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

# i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

# Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.

# Also, we will constrain the inputs to only take numbers from 0 to a max of 1000.

target = int(input()) # Enter a number between 0 and 1000
# 🚨 Do not change the code above ☝️

# Write your code here 👇

total = 0
for number in range(0 , target + 1, 2):
    total += number
print(total)
